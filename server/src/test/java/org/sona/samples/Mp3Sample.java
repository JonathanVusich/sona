 * One-second 440 Hz tones that FFmpeg 4.2 encoded with LAME and tagged, and files derived from them for what no tool
 * at hand writes. The derived ones were written by a one-off script, to the byte layouts in the ID3v2 and MPEG audio
 * specs, and FFmpeg reads back the tags and frames it can (ID3v2.2, and ID3v2.4's compressed and unsynchronised
 * frames).
 *
 * <p>Then the Layer III streams of the ISO/IEC 11172-4 conformance tests, as FFmpeg's test suite has them
 * (fate-suite.ffmpeg.org/mp3-conformance), which cover what LAME never writes, and half-second files that FFmpeg 4.2
 * encoded with LAME and shine from tones with sharp attacks, which LAME codes in short blocks.
